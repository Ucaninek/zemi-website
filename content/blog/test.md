# Introduction

This is an example blog post written in Markdown using Nuxt.js. In this post, we will explore the basics of creating a blog post using Nuxt's markdown module.

## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have Nuxt.js installed on your machine. If not, you can install it by running the following command:

```bash
npm install nuxt
```

## Creating a Markdown File

Create a new file with the `.md` extension in your Nuxt project's `content/blog` directory. This is where you will write your blog post content in Markdown format.

## Writing Content

You can use standard Markdown syntax to write your blog post content. Nuxt's markdown module supports various features such as headings, paragraphs, lists, code blocks, and more.

## Adding Metadata

To provide additional information about your blog post, you can include metadata at the beginning of your Markdown file. This metadata can include the post's title, date, author, and tags.

## Rendering the Markdown

To render the Markdown content in your Nuxt application, you can use the `<nuxt-content>` component. This component will parse and render the Markdown content with the configured options.

```vue
<template>
	<div>
		<nuxt-content :document="require(`~/content/blog/example.md`)" />
	</div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
	// ...
};
</script>
```
